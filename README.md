# KINARM_Iso_Force_Matching

This is a basic isometric force matching task on the Kinarm. This task has three parts: an MVC assessment, a force-matching test, and a fatigue test.

In the MVC assessment, participants are asked to flex about a single joint as much as possible and maintain that level of force for a brief time; successful holds are those that maintain the force within some range for the trial duration. The MVC force is recorded on each successful trial, and all successful trials are averaged to estimate the MVC.

In the force-matching test, participants are asked to flex about a single joint to achieve differing percentages of the MVC, and maintain that requested level of force for a brief time. Participants are not informed what the percentage of the MVC they are producing, and are simly meant to experience the desired force. Particpiants then relax briefly, before being asked to produce the same amount of force without any visual feedback, using either the same or opposite arm. Trials are successful if the requested force level is matched and maintained for the required duration. Following the matching test, there is a relaxation phase.

In the fatigue test, participants will be prompted to achieve a desired level of force; then the visual feedback will disappear and participants will need to maintain that same force level for some duration. The intent is to measure how quickly participants fatigue (i.e., how quickly the exerted force decays or becomes unstable in the absense of visual feedback).
